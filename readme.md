### This is a template for *almost* any ML project written with [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/).

---

Key features:
* Separates model from data. (Uses **torch.utils.data.Dataset** and **torch.nn.Module**).
* Contains few highly reusable helper methods.
* Uses [tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/graph_viz) for visualisation.
* Distributions and Histograms for `tensorboard` are computed automatically. (Images and audio are also supported but might require a lot of disk space).
